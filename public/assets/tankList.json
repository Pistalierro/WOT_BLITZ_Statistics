The British and Soviet design plans collected by SIFAR-SID were taken into account. Development of the project was discontinued at the drafting and modelling stage.",

      "description": "The development of the WZ-111-1G FT tank destroyer was based on the experience of the WZ-111 heavy tank creation. A prototype of the latter was produced in the early 1960s. It underwent running trials, which revealed a number of disadvantages in the vehicle's design, and the development of the WZ-111 was discontinued in 1964. The design of the WZ-111-1G FT shows the Soviet tank-building influence. There is no information about any produced prototypes.",

The design was greatly influenced by promising advancements in German vehicles, and there were plans to incorporate design elements from both American and German vehicles. The vehicle was supposed to be equipped with a magazine loading system that had already been successfully implemented in naval artillery. Another unique feature of the vehicle was the placement of the driver in the turret with limited gun traverse. Eventually, work on this tank destroyer was suspended due to its dependence on its conceptual predecessor. All activity on the MBT-70 was canceled, leading to the discontinuation of the conceptual design, and the vehicle was never built.",

Development on the vehicle began in the first half of the 1960s as a collaboration between the countries of the Western European Union. The project aimed to develop new prototypes of armored vehicles, and was highly influenced by promising designs for German tank destroyers. The vehicle itself was a successor of the turreted tank destroyers produced by the OTO Melara company. Due to a number of reasons, no metal prototype was ever created.",

      "description": "    \r\nIn April of 1942, the Italian command came up with the idea to develop an assault tank destroyer with a 105 mm howitzer on the chassis of the Carro Armato P 40 heavy tank. The project was developing rather slowly, so instead, officials decided to use the improved chassis of the mass-produced Carro Armato M 15/42 for a new vehicle. This vehicle featured a 105 mm howitzer with a length of 23 calibers. The prototype was completed in January 1943, and it became the first Italian vehicle to be partially welded. The serial model, designated Semovente da 105/25 M43, received a 25 caliber gun and a newly designed hull and cabin. Before Italy's capitulation on September 8, 1943, 30 vehicles had already been manufactured and sent to military units. Later these vehicles all fell into the hands of the Germans, who set up and continued production. Between 1943 and 1944, 121 more vehicles were produced.",

      "description": "After the Germans first adopted the use of StuG III assault guns with closed cabins in 1940, the Italians started working on their own vehicle of a similar type. As a basis for their design, they used the chassis of the Carro Armato M 13/40 medium tank. The first prototype of the Semovente da 75/18 was completed in February 1941. Instead of a turret and turret platform, this vehicle featured a closed stationary cabin with a mounted 75 mm Obice da 75/18 modello 34 howitzer. The vehicle armament was sufficient for both providing fire support and fighting against most tanks at the time. Its 50 mm frontal armor could, in theory, withstand most common British two-pounder tank and anti-tank guns from long and medium ranges. Most of the Semovente M41 da 75/18s that fought were lost in North Africa, while others were captured by the Germans in the fall of 1943.",

A total of nine prototypes were manufactured, five of which had the 90-mm gun. Four of the vehicles were planned to have the turret of the T96 tank as well as its 105-mm gun. However, because the turrets of the T96 were not ready at that point, two of the new vehicles received turrets from the mass-produced M48A2 tank, equipped with the M41 rifled gun. These prototypes, designated T95E2, were manufactured from May through July 1957.",

      "description": "This tank was designed in March-August 1949 at OKB IK SV (Special Design Bureau of Engineering Committee of Ground Forces) under the direction of A.F. Kravtsev. As per the design, the tank was planned to feature the driver's seat in the fighting compartment, a 100 mm gun with an autoloader, and a large-caliber coaxial machine gun. The power unit was represented by a 12-cylinder opposed turbo diesel engine. Ski-shaped mountings were to perform the task of support rollers. The K-91 design did not move past the draft stage, and its development stopped in December 1949.",

      "description": "Development of the T95 series started in 1953. In June of the same year, H.L. Yoh Company Inc. presented seven blueprints, including the M-IV-Y project. It was supposed to be a 47-ton medium tank with a standard configuration for American tank building: a cast hull and turret, a 105 mm gun, and four crew members. The most outstanding feature of the project was its oscillating turret. It had a stationary lower frontal part that protected the oscillating segment from damage and jamming. However, further M-IV-Y development was discontinued, and it existed only in blueprints.",

      "description": "The Angry Connor is a British Premium Tier V Tank Destroyer with a unique camouflage and its own war history.\r\nThe vehicle was commanded by Garret O'Connor, an Irish Army officer. He was unable to put up with the fact that Ireland was not participating in World War II and escaped to England together with several other Irish soldiers. He took an active role in military operations and soon became the commander of a Valentine Mk I Archer. O'Connor’s fellow soldiers named the vehicle after its brave and talented commander: the Angry Connor.\r\nThe distinguishing features of this tank destroyer are its terrifying “warpaint” and a barrel fixed on the hull where, according to the legend, it was hit by a German shell. Nobody knows what is inside the barrel as Garret promised to open it only after the end of the war.\r\n",
